            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p class="lead">We believe that everyone deserves a safe, private space to explore their thoughts, track their emotional journey, and grow through self-reflection.</p>
            <p>My Diary was created with a simple yet profound goal: to make journaling accessible, insightful, and transformative for people from all walks of life. In a world that moves faster than ever, we provide the tools you need to slow down, reflect, and understand yourself better.</p>

            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Founded in 2023, My Diary emerged from a personal journey with mental health and self-discovery. Our founder, after struggling with anxiety and stress, discovered the incredible therapeutic benefits of consistent journaling. However, existing solutions were either too basic or overly complex.</p>
            <p>We set out to create something different: a journaling platform that combines the simplicity of traditional diary writing with the power of modern technology. By integrating AI-powered insights, mood tracking, and comprehensive analytics, we've created a tool that not only helps you record your thoughts but also helps you understand them.</p>
